## **Part of Practical AI Learning Modules with __Google Colab__**

## What this Session includes  

- Intro to Pytorch
- Different Data types in Deep Learning
- Practise Dataset - CIFAR10 dataset

## Intro to Pytorch - 

Under this series, I am trying to create small projects that are helpful as a learning modules for beginner's in AI.

* Getting the feel of Pytorch

* Tensors in Pytorch
* Operations
* Numpy to tensors

## Different Data types in Deep Learning
 
1. Image ( Computer Vision )
2. Text ( Natural Language Processing )
3. Audio ( Speech Recognition ) 
4. Video
5. Data generation

## Practise Dataset - CIFAR10 dataset

- About the dataset:

> The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
