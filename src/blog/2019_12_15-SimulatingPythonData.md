## A glimpse of Data driven intelligence approach for product development

The experimentation in Evolution of a an AI Product using Data driven & Artificial Intelligence centric approach. Trying to solve two problems :

1. Imparting necessary human skills to upgrade human intelligence
2. Using Artificial Intelligence to automate repetative tasks and decision making.

## About the approach

* No assumption of how the product will evolve.
* This approach assumes non-specialist participants
* Need based resource utilization
* Centralization of all the raw data
* Timely assessment
* A perfect communication channel between the AI module & participants

    - For Broadcasting the message
    - For personalized message

## Problem : Creating a minimum news channel module that gets geotagged video data & training news reporters at the same time

Data instance : video, person's profile data

Define Problem statement
Get present state of the system ( S0 )
Project future state of the system (S1)
Define processess that will help in transition from S0 to S1.

Assessing learner's progress for a particular skill ( in this case abitlity to speak in front of camera )
Support of Automation tools ( facial recognition )

## Processes

- It has to be simple
- Need's minimum resources
- Define the data generators & collectors

## First Phase : Getting daily news from geotagged location

Demo 1 Day Data

- 1 day video
- Profile
- Location
